        <p>
         An immense mausoleum of white marble, built in Agra between 1631 and 1648 by order of the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his favourite wife, the Taj Mahal is the jewel of Muslim art in India and one of the universally admired masterpieces of the world's heritage.The Taj Mahal is located on the right bank of the Yamuna River in a vast Mughal garden that encompasses nearly 17 hectares, in the Agra District in Uttar Pradesh. It was built by Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his wife Mumtaz Mahal with construction starting in 1632 AD and completed in 1648 AD, with the mosque, the guest house and the main gateway on the south, the outer courtyard and its cloisters were added subsequently and completed in 1653 AD. The existence of several historical and Quaranic inscriptions in Arabic script have facilitated setting the chronology of Taj Mahal. For its construction, masons, stone-cutters, inlayers, carvers, painters, calligraphers, dome builders and other artisans were requisitioned from the whole of the empire and also from the Central Asia and Iran. Ustad-Ahmad Lahori was the main architect of the Taj Mahal.

        <h2>FATEHPUR SIKRI</h2>
        <p>
        Built during the second half of the 16th century by the Emperor Akbar, Fatehpur Sikri (the City of Victory) was the capital of the Mughal Empire for only some 10 years. The complex of monuments and temples, all in a uniform architectural style, includes one of the largest mosques in India, the Jama Masjid.Fatehpur Sikri is located in Agra District in the State of Uttar Pradesh in northern India. It was constructed southeast of an artificial lake, on the slopping levels of the outcrops of the Vindhyan hill ranges. Known as the “city of victory”, it was made capital by the Mughal emperor Akbar (r. 1556-1605 CE) and constructed between 1571 and 1573. Fatehpur Sikri was the first planned city of the Mughals to be marked by magnificent administrative, residential, and religious buildings comprised of palaces, public buildings, mosques, and living areas for the court, the army, the servants of the king and an entire city. Upon moving the capital to Lahore in 1585, Fatehpur Sikri remained as an area for temporary visits by the Mughal emperors.

    <h2>AGRA FORT</h2>
    <p>
        Agra Forts history dates back several centuries. It was originally owned by Rajput rulers. After the First Battle of Panipat (in 1526), Ibrahim Lodhi moved to this fort. Later, Babur, the first Mughal ruler, captured the fort.When the fort came under the control of Akbar, it was almost in ruins and disintegrating. So, its construction began in 1565 and continued until 1573.After its completion, Agra Fort served as the primary residence of Akbar. It also went through several modifications during the reign of subsequent emperors, Jahangir and Shahjahan. The fort was in its prime until 1638 when the capital shifted to Delhi. In 1658, it came under the control of Aurangzeb, the son of Shahjahan. He locked his father here until his death.Agra Fort witnessed several battles throughout its history. And it witnessed the rise and fall of several Mughal rulers.Numerous rulers seized control of the fort after the Mughals. In 1803, the British took over the Agra Fort. And after Indias Independence, it handed its authority to the Government of India. Later, in 1983, Agra Fort was listed as a Heritage Site by UNESCO.
