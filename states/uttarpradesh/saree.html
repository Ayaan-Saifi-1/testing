      <h2>History</h2>
      <p>
        The history of the Banarasi saree dates back to the Mughal era, when Persian artisans and Indian weavers combined their skills to create intricate silk fabrics. Originating in Varanasi (Banaras), these sarees became popular for their luxurious brocade work, often featuring gold and silver zari threads. Mughal motifs like florals, jali patterns, and Persian designs influenced the weaving style. Over time, Banarasi sarees evolved into a symbol of Indian heritage, worn by royalty and nobility. The craftsmanship has been passed down through generations, making Banarasi sarees timeless, particularly prized for weddings and special occasions.
