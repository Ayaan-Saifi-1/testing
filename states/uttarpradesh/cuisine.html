        <h2>Historical Relevance of Awadhi cuisine</h2>
        <p>
            The most famous cuisines in Oudh are Kabobs, Biryani and Nihari. Due to Muslim dominance and influence on the culture and cuisine of this region, you will find that most of the items are meat based. Among the kabobs Shami and Galawati kabobs are the specialty of Lucknow and so are Kulcha-Nihari and Biryani. It should be kept in mind that the Biryani that is cooked in Oudh is quite different from its cousins of Hyderabad and Karachi in Pakistan. The Kanpur region brings Kakori and Boti kabobs. The most famous vegetarian dishes of this region are Tahri and Nargishi kofta. While the former is cooked with rice and lentils, the later has a generous dose of cheese, Khoya and saffron.
