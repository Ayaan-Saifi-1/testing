        <h2>Welcome to the World of Kathak</h2>
        <p>
          Kathak is one of the eight major classical dance forms of India, renowned for its grace, intricate footwork, and storytelling through facial expressions and hand gestures. Originating in the temples of northern India, the word "Kathak" is derived from the Sanskrit word "Katha," meaning story. The dance was initially performed by traveling storytellers known as "Kathakars" who would narrate tales from ancient Indian epics like the Mahabharata and Ramayana. Over time, Kathak evolved into a more sophisticated art form, incorporating elements of both Hindu devotional expression and Persian influences introduced during the Mughal era.

        <h2>History of Kathak</h2>
        <p>
          Kathak evolved as an expression of devotion towards Lord Krishna. Studies suggest that Kathak originated in Varanasi and this dance form traveled through Lucknow, Jaipur, and other parts of North and North West India. 

          The Lucknow tradition of Kathak believes that Lord Krishna appeared in the dream of his devotee, named Ishwari. He instructed her to develop dance as a form of worship, in her dream. Ishwari developed Kathak as a dance form and through her descendants preserved the learning and development, yielding the Lucknow Gharana of Kathak. 
          
          Kathak in the Bhakti movement era revolved around the theme which portrayed the immortal love between Radha, Krishna, and the milkmaids (Gopis).
